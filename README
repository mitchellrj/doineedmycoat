Do I need my coat?
==================

A quick little hack project to fill a silly domain.

Uses geolocation (falling back to geo IP location) to determine
where a user is and then uses the Underground Weather XML API to
determine whether or not you ought to wear a coat in that
location in order to avoid death.
